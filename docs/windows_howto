---=== Windows Build and Run howto ===---

This is the documentation how to build the wirewhark plugin with and for Windows.



---= Windows =---

--- build ---

# Edit the files and create a packet-file.c just like in scr/plugin on github
# In Addition you have to add your plugin name to the 'PLUGIN_SRC_DIRS' in the 'CMakeLists.txt' in the root folder of the Wireshark Sources.
# FOR COMPILING WIRESHARK + PLUGINS IN WINDOWS DO THE FOLLOWING:

1. Install Microsoft C compliler and SDK
2. Install Qt
3. Install Cygwin
4. Install Python V 2.7 (Do not use V 3.0 or above)
5. Install Git and clone the source files
6. Install CMake
7. Open VS Command Prompt:

> set CYGWIN=nodosfilewarning
> set WIRESHARK_BASE_DIR=..\WiresharkSource
> set WIRESHARK_TARGET_PLATFORM=win64 (or 32)
> set QT5_BASE_DIR=..\Qt\5.6\msvc2013_64
> set WIRESHARK_VERSION_EXTRA=-YourExtraVersionInfo

8. (Optional) If your Cygwin installation path is not automatically detected by CMake, you can explicitly specify it with the following environment variable:

> set WIRESHARK_CYGWIN_INSTALL_PATH=..\cygwin64

9. Create and change to the correct build directory:

> mkdir ..\WiresharkSource\wsbuild64
> cd ..WiresharkSource\wsbuild64

10. Generate Build Files:

> cmake -DENABLE_CHM_GUIDES=on -G "Visual Studio 12 Win64" ..\WiresharkSource\wireshark

11.1 Build Wireshark and plugins:
> msbuild /m /p:Configuration=RelWithDebInfo Wireshark.sln

11.2 Build Plugin only:
> msbuild .\plugins\doip\doip.vcxproj

12. (Optional) CleanUp:
> msbuild /m /p:Configuration=RelWithDebInfo Wireshark.sln /t:Clean


--- run ---

- copy doip.ddl and doip.pdb (TODO: really needed?) to C:\Program Files\Wireshark\plugins\2.0.2\ (or the corresponding installation directory and version of wireshark)
- wireshark must be restarted to recognize the plugin (is there another possibility?)
- run wireshark and check running plugin under Help - About Wireshark - Plugins
